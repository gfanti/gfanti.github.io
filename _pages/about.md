I am an assistant professor of <a href="https://ece.cmu.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a courtesy appointment in the <a href="https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> and am a part of  <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu">CyLab</a>. My group's <a href="/research">research focus</a> is on the security and privacy implications of **data transparency**. As part of this focus, my research interests span the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of blockchains, machine learning, distributed systems, and privacy-enhancing technologies.
