I am the Angel Jordan Associate Professor of <a href="https://ece.cmu.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. I have courtesy appointments in the <a href="https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/">Computer Science Department</a> and the <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department</a> and am a part of  <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu">CyLab</a>. My group's <a href="/research">research focus</a> is on the security and privacy implications of **data transparency and sharing**. As part of this focus, my research interests span the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of distributed systems, machine learning, and privacy-enhancing technologies. I am also a co-director of <a href="https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/research/upanzi/index.html">the Upanzi Network</a> alongside <a href="https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty-and-staff/directory/bios/gueye-assane.html">Assane Gueye</a>, and a co-director of the <a href="https://www.initc3.org/">Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts</a>.
